# SGP-based Value Above Last Place Average Player Above Replacement (VAL-PAPAR [val-paÂ·per] has a nice ring to it)

## In Progress........
### High-level overview
The purpose of this folder is that the LeagueSGP... excel sheet is all the off-season work done in order to create a tailored SGP valuation system for my fantasy league by putting a new twist on it: I decided to remove the barrier level stats (the stat level required to actually start gaining SGPs i.e. the average player on the last place team) in order to get a more accurate representation of how many standing points players are actually contributing above the last place team rather than just the raw SGPs used traditionally by SGP practicioners.  Stay tuned to see how it performs in my H2H Each Category 12 Teamer!
